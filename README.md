# Project Around The U.S.

### Description

First js project - first part. this project will be a page that enables a user to place images in a gallery.
For now the user can change their name and about fields only.

Uses js to implement form submition.

### 2nd part update!

Implemented js DOM manipulation to add front-end interactivity: users can now: add an image to gallery, click the heart button to like, remove images from gallery, click an image to display in original size.
also added smooth fade in and out for popups.

### 3rd part update!

Implemented form validation using js. Visitors will now see red notice on forms upon entering invalid input for smooth UX when filling forms.
Used js modules to break script apart to smaller files.

### Update! (Project 7):

Refactor code to achieve basic OOP: 'Card' and 'FormValidator' classes created in order to implement functionality in a convenient OOPy way.
No new functionality added. Accordingly, code has been reorganized using modules.

### Srint 8 Update:

Further refactor achieves even beter abstraction. Classes now perform only their specific function and are loosly coupled, for a coherent description that is easier then to maintain, expand or reuse.
Introduced bundeling using webpack and modules - learning how to deploy IRL.

### Sprint 9 features:

Its time to remove all hard coded information and move to a server. Implementation using asynchronous JS, using promises.
Now all features affect the server side as well, just like a real production site. its easy to see now how information is sent and recieved from a remote database.

Future upgrade ought to include proper UX for unsuccessful fetches, not just console logs.

### Sprint 10 React port:

We are Porting to react! so cool and exciting! this will be a partial port to be completed sprint 10 (?)
react is a distilled webdev description of components (using JSX) library, absolute fun. its so succinct and elegant!

### Sprint 11 React port cntd...

All features implemented using React library, with the exception of form validation, ought to refactor form validation as well.

### Adding registration, authorization and related features and components

Our app now accepts user registration, and log on. Additionally, users do not need to log in on subsequent visits as we use browsers local storage to save the authentication token. I feel confident it would take a 9th grader at least eight minutes to crack my security.
Added tooltip that informs user of succesful registration, or failure of log in/registration. Future update will adjust new components to be responsive as older components are.
